# INDENG-243 Final Project ‚Äì Rental Finder

This repository contains the full codebase for a housing recommendation demo site built for UC Berkeley INDENG 243 - Module 3.

The project is structured into three main components:

üìÅ Project Structure
frontend/
search_map.html
The main frontend HTML file.
Users input queries here (e.g., "Philly big house 2000") and receive housing recommendations as result cards.
A toggleable full-screen map function is included but currently hidden for performance reasons.
