## üåê Project Website ‚Äì Rental Finder

**Live Demo**: [https://ethanhu003.github.io/INDENG-243/](https://ethanhu003.github.io/INDENG-243/)

The website showcases an interactive rental recommendation tool for Philadelphia. It includes:

- A **natural language search bar** that interprets queries (e.g., "Phila big house 2000").
- A list of **recommended listings** with price, size, and score details.
- A **fullscreen interactive map** with toggles for facilities like schools, gyms, restaurants, etc.
- Category-specific icons and map layers with hover popups and legends.
- A responsive, animated, and visually enhanced UI.

This tool demonstrates how user inputs can be converted into meaningful real estate insights using search interpretation, frontend filtering logic, and map-layer interaction design.
